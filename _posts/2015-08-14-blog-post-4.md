biofuels
======

Biofuels are made from living things that have decayed over time. They are often produced from plants or from animal waste.

They are produced quicker than things like fossil fuels (eg. oil, natural gas) etc, which makes them more useful. 

They are oftenly broken down into things like ethanol and then converted to something useful like "bioethanol".
